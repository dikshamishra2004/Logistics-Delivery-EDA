## üîç Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze patterns and trends in logistics delivery performance using data collected on:

- Shipment modes (Flight, Ship, Road)
- Warehouse blocks (A to F)
- Product attributes (importance, weight, cost, discount)
- Customer feedback (ratings, care calls, prior purchases)
- Delivery outcome (On-time vs Late)

## üí° Insights Summary

- **65%** of deliveries were on time; **35%** were late
- **Ship mode** and **Warehouse F** had the highest share of late deliveries
- **High-importance products** were delivered faster than low-priority ones
- **Heavy products** were often discounted more and delayed more
- **Customer loyalty** (prior purchases) was associated with better delivery rates
- **More customer care calls** and **lower ratings** were observed for late deliveries
- **Weight** and **Discount** showed the strongest numerical correlation
